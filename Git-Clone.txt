Commands for copying specific branch or all branches into local working directory
-- First create a directory where all the files locally generated and supposed to be imported from remote repositories.
-- Following commands can be used to start from the scratch
-- Please note that we don't need to initialize our current local working directory with git init command for cloning task.


cd <your directory>
git clone <specify the url of the remote github repo>
git clone https://github.com/rakeshmondal1989/python-DSA.git

-- Now if we want to execute git commands subsequently on the cloned repo then we must initialze our current local directory with
--git init command
git init
-- By default it would be on master branch. 
-- We must go into the remote repo directory in order find and the branches and corresponding files in them
cd <remote repo name>
cd python-DSA
-- Once we are into remote directory which is "python-DSA" in our case, the branch will automatically be switched to main branch 
--We can use following command for seeing which all <other> branches are there inside the remote repo
git fetch --all
git branch --all
--It would show all the branchs we have in our remote repo and move or switch to a specific branch with the below command
git switch <specific branch>
git switch master
-- Then in order to copy all the files of remote master branch we can use git pull command
git pull origin master
ls (It would show all the files of remote master branch)

-- The command below brings up history of commits done on a specific branch
git log --oneline
